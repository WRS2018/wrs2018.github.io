## Travel to Milan

The easiest way to reach the University from the airports is to first get to the Milano Centrale railway station. In order to do so, you can take a bus:

- [ATM Air Bus](http://www.atm.it/en/AltriServizi/Trasporto/Pages/airbus.aspx) from the Linate airport.
- [Malpensa Shuttle](http://www.malpensashuttle.it/en/index.html) from the Malpensa airport.
- [Orioshuttle](http://www.orioshuttle.com/_eng/) from the Orio al Serio airport.
Tickets are sold on board.

As an alternative, you can reach Milano Centrale from the Malpensa airport by first taking a [Malpensa Express train](http://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/) (follow the Trains sign at the Malpensa airport). The ticket can be bought at the booth or the vending machines located inside the airport (just before arriving at the train railways), or on the [website](http://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/).

From Milano Centrale, you can reach the University by taking the line 87 bus, as described [here](https://goo.gl/maps/cdMxNxghGGs). The urban public transport tickets are not sold on board; they can be bought for 1.50 â‚¬ at the vending machines located in the Milano Centrale underground station (or at the newspaper kiosk). If you reached Milano Centrale via the underground, you can use the same ticket, as long as the total duration of the trip does not exceed 75 minutes; notice that you need to validate it again on the bus (click [here](http://www.atm.it/en/ViaggiaConNoi/Biglietti/Pages/Tipologie.aspx) for further details).

You can also reach the University from Milano Centrale via underground. Take the yellow line (line 3) towards Comasina. At the Zara station, exchange with a lilac line (line 5) train towards Bignami and get off there to reach the University. You can see this route [here](https://goo.gl/maps/naXZod6kQir).

Finally, you can also take a taxi from the airports. Please notice that this solution tends to be very expensive, also depending on the traffic; you should ask the taxi driver for an approximate fare before you start the trip.

Instructions for using the public transport to reach the university from other locations in Milano can be obtained via [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/SbjySePQNNn), by searching for *Viale Sarca 336* or *Edificio U14 - DISCo* as the destination.

For further information, see also the [Reach us by public transport page](https://www.unimib.it/come-raggiungerci) on the university website.
