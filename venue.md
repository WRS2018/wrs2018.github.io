### The City

[Milan](https://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/en/) is the capital of the Lombardy region, located in the north of Italy. With more than 3.2 million people living in the city and its surroundings, Milan is the most densely populated metropolitan area in Italy.

The history of the city dates back to before the conquest by the Roman Empire in the second century CE, after which the city was named “Mediolanum” (meaning “In the middle of the plain”, which referred to the position of the settlement in the Po Valley). Today, Milan is one of the biggest economic and cultural centers of the country, featuring several museums, theatres and historical landmarks attracting millions of tourists every year. The city is also near to several naturalistic sites of northern Italy, such as Lake Como, Lake Garda and the Alps.
