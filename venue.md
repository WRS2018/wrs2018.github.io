This workshop will take place in Milano in the period June 11 - 15, 2018.

It is organized by the Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication of University of Milano-Bicocca.

Those interested in attending the workshop should send an email to Prof. G Mauri ([mauri@disco.unimib.it](mailto:mauri@disco.unimib.it)) announcing their intention.
This will help the organizing committee to plan lecture and discussion facilities, refreshments, lunches, lodging, etc. It is currently expected that there will only be a "symbolic" registration fee.
